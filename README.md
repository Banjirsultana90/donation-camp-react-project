****Route Configuration: 
we can define routes inour application using the <Route> component. These routes determine which component should be rendered when a specific URL is accessed. we can nest routes to create a hierarchy of views.

****Nested Routes: 
React Router supports nested routes, which means we can have routes within routes. This is useful for creating complex user interfaces with multiple levels of navigation.

****Route Parameters: 
we can use route parameters to capture dynamic values from the URL, allowing us to create dynamic and data-driven views. For example,we can define a route like /users/:id to capture the id parameter from the URL.
